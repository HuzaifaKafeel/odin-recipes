    <h1>Nashville Hot Chicken</h1>
    <h2>What is Nashville Hot Chicken</h2>
    <text>
        <p>
            The name gives a lot away: Nashville hot chicken — fried chicken with a spicy kick — originated in Nashville, Tennessee.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first Nashville hot chicken (served with white bread and pickles) is believed to have come from Prince's Hot 
            Chicken Shack in Nashville. But the delicious fiery chicken has expanded nationwide, served daily at countless 
            restaurants and in home kitchens.
